SWEN222-Game-Project
====================

This project was created for SWEN222 at Victoria University of Wellington.
It was a group project with five members, the goal was to create a game based
on the requirements given in the handout.pdf

My individual reponsibilty was graphics rendering.

I obtained game art and music that were released under public licenses.

The images for the scenery, buildings, foilage etc. is by a game artist by the name
of Daniel Cook and can be founnd at http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/07/more-free-game-graphics.html

For the droppable items I used another large tileset of icons
by Henrique Lazarini at http://7soul1.deviantart.com/?rnrd=74632

The music was obtained from the Open Game Art Bundle at http://open.commonly.cc/unlocked
